      <p>The {{THEME_SITENAME}} portal is an internal tool for physicists to preserve the various materials produced in the process of their analysesanalysis, e.g. datasets, code, documentation. By using Analysis Preservation researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and ­ depending on selected permissions­ also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.</p>
      <p>To make the tool as easy to use as possible it is integrated with existing databases and platforms used in the collaborations and in the community overall. The aim is to reduce the burden on the researcher side and to avoid the duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues. A powerful search engine allows collaborators to search for elements of an analysis, such as trigger information or selection criteria. And of course, sharing and searching depend on the access restrictions within the collaboration.</p> 
      <p>The Analysis Preservation tool serves the High­Energy Physics community and corresponds to current data management policies which have been put into place by funding agencies in recent years. These policies demand data management that facilitates future reuse and reproducibility of research outcomes. Analysis Preservation and <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/" target="_blank">Open Data</a> enable researchers to comply with these requirements while offering functionalities to simplify internal research workflows and publishing procedures.</p>
      <p>Analysis Preservation is being developed and operated by CERN IT and the Scientific Information Service, as well as the LHC collaborations.</p>
